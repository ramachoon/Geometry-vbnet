# Geometry Calculator

## GUI:
- The user should be able to use mouse clicks to draw simple lines, points, and circles on a picture box.
- Allow selection of features and then buttons to select measurement type like Min, Max etc.
- The calculated results should be displayed in a separate window.

## Calculations:
1. Distance between Circle and a point. (Min, Max, Center and Tangent)
2. Angle between two selected lines
3. Distance between point and Line (Min, Max and Perpendicular distance)
4. Distance between two circles ( Min, Max, both Tangents and Center)
5. Distance between a point and Intersection of two lines.

# Outlier Finder
VB.NET app to indentify the outliers using a set of XY coordinates and draw it.

## Best fit circle finder
-Find/draw the best fit circles from X-Y coordinates.
-Identify outliers in the data by using the found circle.

## Trend line finder
-Find/draw the trend line from X-Y coordinates.
-Identify outliers in the data by using the found line.

# Incoporate Geometry Calculator and Outlier Finder

1.	Make the project MDI so that I can add more forms, in my side. 
2.	Increase the size of the picture box to 1000*750
3.	Remove the mouse function altogether. Pick up X Y Coordinates from two Text boxes called CurrentX and CurrentY, by adding a button called "Save Point". 
4.	Objects made by Outlier to be recognized by measurement functions. 
5.	Add Zoom in and out
6.	In addition to Circle add function of ARC. Just same as circle but drawing will be between farthest points. 
7.	Selection to be limited to two items only. Like only two lines can be selected at a time. Or a point and a circle. And after we log result, then remove selection. 
8.	Provide relevant measurement on Context Menu. 
9.	Make a results table and append all measurement results in it. Eventually they will be posted to Excel and PDF. 
10.	In Circle also show distance of each point to Best Fit Circle in thin red line. 
11.	Provide option of deleting any object on Context menu. 
12.	In case of Angles - on context menu add option of 90- Delta, 180-Delta, 270-Delta and 360-Delta.
