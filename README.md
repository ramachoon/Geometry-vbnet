- Allow selection of features and then buttons to select measurement type like Min, Max etc.
- The calculated results should be displayed in a separate window.

## Calculations:
1. Distance between Circle and a point. (Min, Max, Center and Tangent)
2. Angle between two selected lines
3. Distance between point and Line (Min, Max and Perpendicular distance)
4. Distance between two circles ( Min, Max, both Tangents and Center)
5. Distance between a point and Intersection of two lines.
